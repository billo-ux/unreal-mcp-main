# Asset Creation Tools Validation

This document outlines the validation process for the newly implemented asset creation tools for Unreal Engine.

## Validation Approach

Since we cannot directly test these tools in the current environment without an active Unreal Engine instance, we'll validate them through:

1. Code review for completeness and correctness
2. Documentation of expected behavior
3. Instructions for user testing

## Completeness Check

The implemented asset creation tools cover the following categories from the Unreal Engine dropdown menus:

### Animation
- ✅ Animation Blueprint
- ✅ Animation Composite
- ✅ Animation Layer Interface (via Animation Blueprint)
- ✅ Animation Montage
- ✅ Aim Offset
- ✅ Blend Space
- ✅ Pose Asset

### Artificial Intelligence
- ✅ Behavior Tree
- ✅ Blackboard

### Audio
- ✅ Sound Cue

### Blueprint
- ✅ Blueprint Class

### Cinematics
- ✅ Level Sequence

### Material
- ✅ Material
- ✅ Material Instance

### Physics
- ✅ Physics Asset

### User Interface
- ✅ Widget Blueprint

### Niagara
- ✅ Niagara System
- ✅ Niagara Emitter

### Level
- ✅ Level

### Texture
- ✅ Render Target

### Gameplay
- ✅ Game Mode
- ✅ Game State
- ✅ Player Controller

## Integration with Unreal MCP Server

To integrate these tools with the Unreal MCP server, the following changes need to be made to `unreal_mcp_server.py`:

1. Import the asset creation tools module:
```python
from asset_creation_tools import register_asset_creation_tools
```

2. Register the tools during server initialization:
```python
# Register asset creation tools
register_asset_creation_tools(mcp)
```

3. Update the server prompt to include the new asset creation tools.

## Testing Instructions

To test these tools:

1. Place the `asset_creation_tools.py` file in the same directory as your `unreal_mcp_server.py`
2. Update your `unreal_mcp_server.py` as described above
3. Start the MCP server
4. Use the tools to create various asset types
5. Verify that the assets are created in the Unreal Engine editor

Example usage:

```python
# Create a Blueprint class
result = create_blueprint_class(
    asset_name="BP_MyActor",
    parent_class="/Script/Engine.Actor",
    save_path="/Game/Blueprints"
)

# Create an Animation Blueprint
result = create_animation_blueprint(
    asset_name="ABP_Character",
    skeleton_path="/Game/Characters/Mannequin/Mesh/UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton",
    save_path="/Game/Animations"
)
```

## Known Limitations

1. Some asset types may require additional parameters or setup in the Unreal Engine editor after creation
2. The tools rely on the Unreal Engine's command system, which may have limitations or differences across engine versions
3. Error handling is implemented but may not cover all edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Test the tools in an actual Unreal Engine environment
2. Add more specific asset types and subcategories as needed
3. Enhance error handling and validation
4. Add support for configuring asset properties after creation

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
This document outlines the requirements for an AI-driven game prototyping co-pilot focused exclusively on Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). The system empowers solo developers to design, iterate, and manage any game genre through natural interactions—voice, images, clicks, and annotations—without manual coding or external asset procurement. Deep integration with UE5 automates project setup, level design, Blueprints, audio/VFX, UI, storytelling, version control, live reporting, and resource management.

### 1.2 Purpose
Provide a comprehensive PRD outlining functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, technical constraints, and UI/UX guidelines for a UE5-focused prototyping co-pilot.

---

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Problem Statement
Solo developers spend excessive time on routine UE5 tasks, asset imports, and scripting. Existing solutions lack unified, multimodal AI assistance within the UE5 editor.

### 2.2 Solution Summary
A MCP server-based coding co-pilot, evolving into a local AI agentic co-pilot embedded in UE5, interprets voice, vision, click, and annotation inputs to automate engine workflows via a plugin-based API. Optional cloud services for advanced inference and distributed compute, but core functionality remains on-device.

## 3. Goals and Objectives

- **Accelerate prototyping:** Reduce time from concept to playable UE5 prototype by ≥80%.
- **Support all genres:** FPS, RPG, platformer, puzzle, VR, multiplayer, etc.
- **Enable multimodal control:** Speech, image/sketch, click-to-select, annotations, doodles.
- **Automate end-to-end UE5 workflow:** Project initialization, level creation, asset placement, scripting, UI, audio/VFX, camera, testing, packaging.
- **Ensure real-time responsiveness:** Dynamic resource management to avoid editor lag.
- **Version control & reporting:** Auto-commit, changelogs, GitHub integration.
- **Future-proof:** Seamless upgrade to UE6+, plugin auto-update, backward-compatible APIs.

---

## 4. Target Audience

- Solo indie developers without large teams or budgets.
- Small studios needing rapid UE5 prototypes.
- Technical designers who prefer natural input over manual scripting.
- Educators and students exploring game development with AI support.

## 5. Features and Requirements

### 5.1 Interaction Modalities

- **Voice commands:** Local STT (e.g., Whisper), optional TTS, conversational Q&A.
- **Image & sketch input:** Drag‑drop or stylus, vision model (e.g., LLaVA) for map/layout and UI doodles.
- **Point-and-click:** Viewport click → actor/asset identification; spatially aware commands.
- **Annotation overlay:** Draw circles/comments in-editor; agent polls and acts on annotations.

### 5.2 Core AI Orchestrator

- Local LLM (e.g., Code Llama 13B) for intent parsing, planning, Blueprint/C++ generation.
- Vision and audio modules for multimodal understanding.
- Task planner with short-term context and long-term memory (vector DB).

### 5.3 UE5 Plugin Architecture

- UE5 editor plugin exposing a JSON‑RPC/HTTP API for commands:
  - Project/level management (new_level(), open_level())
  - Actor and asset operations (spawn_actor(), set_actor_property())
  - Blueprint graph manipulation (create_blueprint(), add_node(), compile_blueprint())
  - Audio/VFX (create_sound_cue(), create_niagara_emitter())
  - Camera/cinematics (create_sequence(), key_camera())
  - Click capture and annotation hooks
  - Configuration panel for modal settings and thresholds

### 5.4 UE5 Integration Points

- Project setup: templates selection, platform configurations.
- Level design: landscape creation, procedural placement based on sketches.
- Asset placement: spawn and arrange meshes; material assignment.
- Scripting: generate and compile Blueprints or C++ classes; compile‑fix loop.
- UI: doodle-to-UMG widget generation and event binding.
- Audio/VFX: on-demand SFX/music creation and Niagara emitter scripting.
- Camera: cinematic sequences and dynamic camera controls by voice/click.
- MetaHuman & facial animation: spawn/configure MetaHumans; control blendshapes.
- Testing: Play-In-Editor commands; AI-driven test bots; log collection.
- Packaging: automated BuildCookRun for target platforms with signing keys.

### 5.5 Version Control & Reporting

- Git automation: stage, commit, and push changes with auto‑generated Markdown changelog.
- Live status: status queries return current task, progress %, ETA; milestone alerts.

### 5.6 Resource Management

- Monitoring: continuous CPU/GPU/RAM usage tracking.
- Throttling: pause or downscale non-critical AI tasks when thresholds exceeded.
- Model switching: swap to lighter models under high load; batch heavy jobs for idle times.

### 5.7 Upgradability

- .uplugin compatibility entries for UE5.x/6.x; preprocessor guards for breaking changes.
- Orchestrator-driven plugin fetch/build/restart workflow for seamless engine upgrades.

### 5.8 Optional Cloud & Scaling

- API fallbacks: GPT-4, Claude, paid diffusion/audio services.
- Distributed compute: remote GPUs, Colab.
- Asset store integration: Marketplace, Sketchfab placeholders.
- Cloud streaming: VR/editor remote sessions on cloud render farms.

## 6. User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

| ID     | User Story                                                                 | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                   |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ST-101 | As a developer, I want to start the co-pilot by voice so I can keep hands free. | Voice command transcribed ≥95% accuracy; agent acknowledges and enters listening mode.                |
| ST-102 | As a developer, I want to import a level sketch so the AI builds the terrain accordingly. | Vision model interprets sketch into heightmap; landscape created matching topology within 5s.         |
| ST-103 | As a developer, I want to click on an actor and ask "what is this?" to identify assets. | Click resolves to actor/asset; agent returns asset name, type, and Content Browser path.              |
| ST-104 | As a developer, I want to circle a bridge and say "widen by 50%" to scale the mesh correctly. | Annotation selects bridge; mesh scales 50% on width axis; confirmation message displayed.             |
| ST-105 | As a developer, I want to doodle UI mocks so the co-pilot generates UMG widgets. | UI doodle segmented into elements; corresponding UMG widget created with placeholder events.          |
| ST-106 | As a scripter, I want the AI to generate and compile a Blueprint for shooting mechanics. | Blueprint created and error-free; input event spawns projectile and applies damage on hit.            |
| ST-107 | As an audio designer, I want to generate ambient SFX via voice so I can prototype sound. | Audio file generated locally; imported as Sound Cue and plays correctly.                              |
| ST-108 | As a VFX artist, I want to create a Niagara dust emitter via text so I can preview effects. | Niagara emitter asset created; emitter behavior matches prompt and previews in viewport.              |
| ST-109 | As a lead, I want the AI to commit and push changes with a changelog so I can track history. | Commit message includes a Markdown changelog of actions; push to remote succeeds and agent reports summary. |
| ST-110 | As a security officer, I want secure GitHub authentication so only authorized pushes occur. | OAuth or token flow enforced; failure prompts re-authentication.                                      |
| ST-111 | As a user, I want to query "status" during long tasks to know progress and ETA. | Agent reports current task, % complete, and ETA within ±10s accuracy.                                 |
| ST-112 | As a performance manager, I want dynamic throttling at >80% GPU so Editor remains responsive. | When GPU >80%, AI tasks pause or switch to lighter models; Editor FPS remains ≥30.                    |
| ST-113 | As a developer, I want to upgrade to UE6 and auto-update the plugin for compatibility. | Agent detects UE6; fetches matching plugin version; restarts Editor with plugin enabled.              |
| ST-114 | As a developer, I want the co-pilot to remember project context across sessions. | Memory DB persists entities (e.g., "BossEnemy"); recalled accurately in new sessions.                 |
